         <p> People say I'm a little bit cocky and immature, but guess what? everyone knows I'm the most 
            talented NYPD detective stationed in Brooklyn's 99th Precinct, uhhh welcome. 
            I do indeed have the best arrest record among my colleagues.
            I am a very laid-back individual, but I job seriously and like the arresting-bad-guys part the most. 
            I end up in clashes with Captain Holt because of the his practical, down-to-earth methods against my wisecracking nature. 
             Big fan of the movie Die Hard, always been excited when I get an opportunity to act out a Die Hard scene during police work.

            I am a 1981 born, New York City. Jewish American New Yorker, raised by my mother after 
            his dad walked out on them when Jake was only seven years old. Me and Gina attended the same elementary and high school. 
            As children, the we would hang out at my Nana's apartment after school.

     <ul class="myProjects"> 
      <li class="Project"> Solving a murder case and recovering 21 million dollars (yeah you read that right) of stolen money from an armored car depot, is arguably one of the biggest solves in moi career. Guess who got a chopper to travel around with? Me, ofcourse. </li> 
      <li class="Project"> Solved a Case in 48 Hours, starting with Zero Proof.Arrested Dustin Whitman without sufficient evidence, starting the 48-hour clock before we had to release him with no charges. However, with time running out and with all options seemingly exhausted, I found that Dustin worked with his former cellmate and planned the heist together. Classic Jake Move.
         
         </li> </li>
      <li class ="Project">Spent a sleepless night and digged through the evidence, especially the polygraph test of the alleged culprit’s wife. That’s when I deduced that the victim and culprit switched places, thus solving the unsolvable case. </li> </ul>
